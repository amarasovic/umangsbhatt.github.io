Upon moving to the United Kingdom in Fall 2019, I decided that I wanted to *attempt* to visit every country in Europe before I finish my Ph.D. I will keep a running list of countries here (along with the date and city I first visited):

1. Spain: January 25, 2020. (Barcelona for FAT 2020)
1. France: January 9, 2020. (Nice with DS and SS)
1. United Kingdom: April 1, 2019 (London to see AW)
